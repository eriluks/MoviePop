# MoviePop
This is an application which fetches data from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API and displays the results. The user can look at various movies displayed by category such as "The Most Popular Movies" or "The Most Popular Dramas" and etc.

If a movie in the list is 'clicked' then more details on the movie will be displayed.
The user can also search a movie by going into the 'Search' tab where if a movie title is written, a list of movies associated with that title will display.

The application was created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and it was styled using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).



You can try the [Live Demo](https://moovie-44853.firebaseapp.com).
